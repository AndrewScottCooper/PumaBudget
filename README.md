# PumaBudget
Just a simple personal budgeting project

This is phase one of two, this is an early protoype of the final product.

There are many bugs with this project that need to be worked through, most of which are very simple and will be quickly removed.

To save your data, click on another tab on the main menu and all your data will be saved.

To refresh the graphs on the main overview page, restart the program. It's annoying but it works for now.

Like I said there are many ways to break this program. If for whatever reason you find this before those changes are made and want to take a look, just keep that in mind. Or try to find new creative ways to break it and I'll do my best to fix those problems quickly.

This is a dead projcet made from a bet with mysister in the fastest time possible. I will get around to polishing it up sometime, but am currently working on bigger more important projects. Hopefully no one sees this. If you do Im sorry.
